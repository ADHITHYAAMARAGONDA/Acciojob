Component & Multi-Component Generator Platform

Component & Multi-Component Generator Platform is an AI-powered micro-frontend playground that allows authenticated users to generate, preview, tweak, and export React components or full pages. The platform preserves chat history and code edits across sessions for a seamless iterative development experience. It features secure authentication, live previews, code inspection, and export capabilities, all hosted live for easy access.

Problem Statement :
Modern UI developers and designers need a streamlined environment to create and iterate on reusable components quickly, leveraging AI for code generation. Existing tools often lack stateful editing, integrated chat-based UI generation, and easy export of generated code. This project solves these challenges by providing a secure, persistent platform where users can chat with an AI to generate React components, preview them live, edit code, and export their work — all while saving progress between sessions.

Objectives and Key Learnings
Objectives:

Implement secure authentication with JWT and protected routes

Support chat-driven React component generation with AI backend

Provide live rendering of generated components as sandboxed micro-frontends

Persist chat history, code edits, and UI state for users

Enable code inspection with syntax highlighting and export options

Build a user-friendly, responsive interface for iterative UI development

Key Learnings:

Building REST APIs with Node.js and Express

Managing authentication and sessions securely

Integrating AI language models for code generation

Advanced React state management using custom hooks and Zustand

Live previewing React components safely via iframe sandboxing

Implementing file export and copy-to-clipboard features

Full-stack project structuring with frontend and backend separation

REST APIs with Node.js + Express Backend  
      ↕  
MongoDB (via Mongoose)  
      ↕  
Redis (Session Caching)
Frontend: React components with Vite bundler, client-side routing, Zustand for state management, chat panel, live preview, and code editors.

Backend: Node.js Express REST APIs handling auth, chat sessions, AI prompt processing, and database operations.

Database: MongoDB storing user info, sessions, chat history, and generated code.

Cache: Redis for session and chat state caching.

AI Integration: Calls to external or self-hosted LLM APIs for code generation and refinement.

Deployment: Vercel for frontend, Heroku/Render/AWS for backend services.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React, Vite, Zustand, React Router (or Next.js pages paradigm), Monaco Editor (or CodeMirror), Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, JWT, bcrypt, Mongoose (MongoDB ORM)

Database: MongoDB

Cache: Redis

AI Models: GPT-4o-mini / LLaMA / Gemini via APIs

Deployment: Vercel, Heroku, AWS, Render

Tools: Postman, Git/GitHub, ESLint, Prettier
